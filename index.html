                        <h4>Purpose and Goal</h4>
                        <p>Operational coastal units are seen as a relatively untested and novel approach to coastal analysis that could hold particular potential in decision-making processes that require considering both local conditions and regional transferability. At its most simplistic, the operational coastal unit method assumes that there is value in defining new boundaries for where particular strategies are or are not applicable based on the contextual conditions found in specific places. And perhaps most importantly, that these new boundaries need not respond to existing administrative jurisdictions. Underpinning this idea are two overarching goals, balanced with one another.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p>That local conditions and context are important culturally and ecologically. Decision-making regarding the shoreline should take into consideration the cultural values and knowledge that exist and have evolved in those specific areas. Additionally, the ecological context of any given location should be considered as important and special as opposed to generalized into a larger and more abstract idea of 'ecology'. In these ways, local conditions can be both acknowledged and formative in the decision-making processes to encourage the development of more sensitive and contextual outcomes. Put simply, the more local, the better.</p></li>
                            <li><p>That transferability is to some degree essential to the practicality of any formal coastal management decision. This does not mean that transferability is what is desired, but only that it is what is necessary to get projects funded and completed. In this way, projects should aim to be as contextually specific as possible while only being as transferable as necessary. However, in the correct circumstances, transferability could provide the opportunity for ideas to spread within areas of similar contextual conditions which does offer both cost savings and project innovation.</p></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>With these two balanced goals in mind, this project aims to establish a method for creating coastal units that are particular and appropriate for a given task. This specific project asks to look at the application of the operational coastal units in coastal management decisions that involve strategic sediment management and adaptability as a defining feature, although many other objectives could also be met with the coastal unit methods and efforts have been made to develop a more robust unit structure to accommodate some of these alternative objectives.</p>

                    <p>Operational coastal units are seen as a relatively untested and novel approach to coastal analysis that could hold particular potential in decision-making processes that require considering both local conditions and regional transferability. At its most simplistic, the operational coastal unit method assumes that there is value in defining new boundaries for where particular strategies are or are not applicable based on the contextual conditions found in specific places. And perhaps most importantly, that these new boundaries need not respond to existing administrative jurisdictions. Underpinning this idea are two overarching goals, balanced with one another.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><p>That local conditions and context are important culturally and ecologically. Decision-making regarding the shoreline should take into consideration the cultural values and knowledge that exist and have evolved in those specific areas. Additionally, the ecological context of any given location should be considered as important and special as opposed to generalized into a larger and more abstract idea of 'ecology'. In these ways, local conditions can be both acknowledged and formative in the decision-making processes to encourage the development of more sensitive and contextual outcomes. Put simply, the more local, the better.</p></li>
                        <li><p>That transferability is to some degree essential to the practicality of any formal coastal management decision. This does not mean that transferability is what is desired, but only that it is what is necessary to get projects funded and completed. In this way, projects should aim to be as contextually specific as possible while only being as transferable as necessary. However, in the correct circumstances, transferability could provide the opportunity for ideas to spread within areas of similar contextual conditions which does offer both cost savings and project innovation.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>With these two balanced goals in mind, this project aims to establish a method for creating coastal units that are particular and appropriate for a given task. This specific project asks to look at the application of the operational coastal units in coastal management decisions that involve strategic sediment management and adaptability as a defining feature, although many other objectives could also be met with the coastal unit methods and efforts have been made to develop a more robust unit structure to accommodate some of these alternative objectives.</p>

This is the overall fidelity or detail of the unit generation process along the length of the selected study area. It is effectively the “cell size” that the selected area is split into before attributes are applied to them and they are then re-assembled into units. For example: If 50 meters is selected as the resolution, the selected study area will be split into 50-meter segments along its length and attributes of the following steps applied to those 50-meter segments.</P>

These are the topics of interest to the user that assemble different data sets together to be applied to the cells created in the previous step. For example: If “coastal erosion” and “habitat creation” are selected, datasets will be assembled to create operational coastal units that prioritize coastal erosion first and habitat creation second. The outcome of this process is the application of a rating for each segment from 0-1, based on how it applies to the selected priorities.

For example, in Figure 5 below, the user selected 3 groups, making values of 1-3 in the red group, 4-6 in the yellow group, and 7-10 in the blue group. As the example illustrates, 3 groups do not equal 3 units, (the example has 6 units) as the unit number will vary based on the distribution of priority ratings.</P>

                                    <strong>Retreat rate:</strong> The retreat rate is one of the properties of the sediment budget, which is produced by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Similar to the other values from the sediment budget that are used in the sediment loss/gain model, the retreat rate value is recorded through a series of cells, each measuring approximately a half mile in length. Specifically, the retreat rate is the rate at which the shoreline is eroding, measured in feet per year.

                                    <strong>Shoreline type:</strong> The shoreline type GIS data contains baseline hardened shoreline classification, which specifies the current shoreline condition along the study area. The original data was created for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office for Coastal Management, in partnership with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and funded through the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to support detailed shoreline mapping.

                                    <strong>Soil erosion K factor:</strong> The soil K factor used in this model is from the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service's Web Soil Survey. Based on their description, the K factor indicates the susceptibility of soil to sheet and rill erosion by water. The estimates are based primarily on the percentage of silt, sand, and organic matter and on soil structure and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat). Values of K range from 0.02 to 0.69. Other factors being equal, the higher the value, the more susceptible the soil is to sheet and rill erosion by water. Specifically, we are using the K factor for the whole soil, which includes modifications based on the presence of rock fragments.

                                <li>Rescale: the actual retreat rate value of all the resolution will be projected to a scale of 0 to 1, where closer to 0 means less shoreline erosion and closer to 1 means more shoreline erosion.</li>

                                <li>Because the shoreline type is categorical data, we assign a value of 0 to 5 to each category based on the category's eroding characteristics, and then rescale it to a scale of 0 to 1.
